In the context of a competitive e-commerce industry, data becomes a crucial asset for analysis to understand the factors influencing monthly sales volume. The collected data spanning twelve months includes several variables deemed to have significant impact on sales volume. The observed variables are as follows:
1. x1 (Visitors): Number of website visitors per month.
2. x2 (Transactions): Monthly transaction count.
3. x3 (Items/Transaction): Average number of items per transaction.
4. x4 (Rating): Customer satisfaction rating on a scale of 1–10.
5. x5 (Ads): Number of online advertisements run per month.
6. y (Sales): Monthly sales volume in thousands of USD.
This data covers the period from January to December, with each month having recorded values for these variables. The primary goal at this stage is to understand the relationships among these variables and employ multiple linear regression to model them. Subsequently, an interactive dashboard will be developed using R Shiny, allowing stakeholders to easily input predictor values and obtain sales volume estimates.
This analysis will provide in-depth insights into how variables such as website visitors, transactions, average items per transaction, customer satisfaction rating, and online advertisements impact monthly sales performance. Multiple linear regression methodology will be utilized to model the complex relationships among these variables and formulate equations for predicting future sales volume.
Once the model is constructed, we will detail the evaluation steps involving testing model assumptions, testing coefficient significance, and interpreting these coefficients. Furthermore, the results of this analysis will be integrated into R Shiny for stakeholders’ ease in understanding the impact of predictor variable changes on sales volume.
With a profound understanding of the factors influencing sales, companies can design more effective marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately improve their sales performance. This analysis can also offer strategic insights into which variables most influence sales and whether there is a significant interaction between website visitors and online advertisements affecting sales concurrently.”
